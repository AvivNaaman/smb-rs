This project is the first rust implementation of [SMB2 & 3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-smb2/5606ad47-5ee0-437a-817e-70c366052962) client -- the protocol that powers Windows file sharing and remote services. The project is designed to be used as a crate, but also includes a CLI tool for basic operations.

While most current implementations are mostly bindings to C libraries (such as libsmb2, samba, or windows' own libraries), this project is a full implementation in Rust, with no dependencies on C libraries!

## Getting started
Running the project's CLI is as simple as executing:
```sh
cargo run -- --help
```
Check out the `info` and the `copy` sub-commands for more information.

For advanced usage, and crate usage, see the [Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage) section.
## Features
- ✅ SMB 2.X & 3.X support.
- ✅ Async (`tokio`), Multi-threaded, or Single-threaded client.
- ✅ Compression & Encryption support.
- ✅ Transport using SMB over TCP (445), over NetBIOS (139), and over QUIC (443).
- ✅ NTLM & Kerberos authentication (using the [`sspi`](https://crates.io/crates/sspi) crate).
- ✅ Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS).

You are welcome to see the project's roadmap in the [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/AvivNaaman/projects/2).

## Using the crate
Check out the `Client` struct, exported from the `smb` crate, to initiate a connection to an SMB server:

```rust,no_run
use smb::{Client, ClientConfig, UncPath, FileCreateArgs, FileAccessMask, ReadAtChannel};
use std::str::FromStr;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // instantiate the client
    let client = Client::new(ClientConfig::default());
    
    // Connect to a share
    let target_path = UncPath::from_str(r"\\server\share").unwrap();
    client.share_connect(&target_path, "username", "password".to_string()).await?;
    
    // And open a file on the server
    let file_to_open = target_path.with_path("file.txt");
    let file_open_args = FileCreateArgs::make_open_existing(FileAccessMask::new().with_generic_read(true));
    let resource = client.create_file(&file_to_open, &file_open_args).await?;

    // now, you can do a bunch of operations against `file`, and close it at the end.
    let file = resource.unwrap_file();
    let mut data: [u8; 1024] = [0; 1024];
    file.read_at(&mut data, 0).await?;

    // and close
    file.close().await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Check out the [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/smb/latest/smb/index.html) for more information regarding usage.

## Development
To set up a development environment, you may use any supported rust version.

* It is highly recommended to use rust nightly, and install pre-commit hooks (using `pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install`)
* Before committing your changes, run `cargo fmt` to format the code, and `cargo clippy` to check for linting issues.
* Run crate tests once you are ready to commit. Read tests' README.md before proceeding!
